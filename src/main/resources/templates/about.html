        <h1>What is Magnum Opus Hub?</h1>

        <p>Magnum Opus Hub represents a way artists can showcase their masterpieces via digital exhibitions via our Virtual Museum. Taking into consideration the fact that digital artists are forced to go from digital to analogue in order to expose their artworks via an exhibition, we got a solution: a software in witch they can express their work in a raw digital way.</p>
        <p>Our exhibitions will include only digital artists showcasing digital art/ content only. Some clear examples are: 3D Rendered Sculptures Exhibition, NFT Collection, Graphic Design, UI/UX Projects, Videography, Typography Posters and the list goes on.</p>

        <p> The projectâ€™s goal is to create an environment where digital artists belong and can express themselves in a raw digital way, without the need of translating their work in an analogue alternative, with the use of extensive technology: web and game engine.

            Our objective is to create a place where art enthusiasts can see displayed digital masterpieces from wherever place they are and interact via keyboards with each piece of art. We want to collaborate with local digital artist and showcase their work internationally. Also by creating this Virtual Museum we intend to develop an artistic hub as a digital artist guild and movement in order to advertise their work.
            On our website, the user can join as a guest or register an account in order to be part of the community. The perks of joining are the following: being a member of the hub, receiving e-mail notifications of the following events whenever one is created and a link to join the exhibition, exclusive content and the chance to donate crypto currencies to the artists. After he joins, he can select a Gallery Event in which he can take part of. After selecting it, he will be redirected to the Virtual Museum. There he can freely move around and explore the world, interact with each masterpiece and find out more about the artist.
        </p>
        <p>                We are aware that an exhibition is not only about a visual experience. We will artificially recreate other senses like: cognitive (the user can interact with specific elements) and auditive (we will collaborate with local music artists in order to create a custom playlist for every exhibition that fits the content. The user can easily control it via keys on the web interface)
            This initiative came from the need of digital art exposure in Romania and the need of seeing an exhibition digitally no matter the place or the pandemic circumstances.</p>
